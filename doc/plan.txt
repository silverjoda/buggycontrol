Plan:

# Mission: Obtain High performing buggy agent:
- Get High performing agent!

# Mission: Transfer
- Check what caused mujoco a2c list out of index error in engines (line 138)
- Check why there is a cap on 301 steps in the env (is there a done condition that depends on the remaining traj that activates?)
- Check that expert trajectories and buggy env are the same in obs/action space (ranges: turn -0.4,0.4, throttle 0:1)
- Make visualization of obtained trajectories in gathered trajectories
- Make test script on gathered trajectories
- Obtain well trained model
- Train RMA-style
- Compare RMA-style with trained model transfer

# Mission: Trajectory optimization using TEP
- Code up a moose test problem using gradient barrier functions
- Debug the trajectory optimization problem
- train TEP
- Test TEP trajectory optimization
