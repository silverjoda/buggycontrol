Plan:


Friday:
- Debug and visualize ss-traj training
- Add trajectory observation transformation to buggy frame!
- Try RL on buggy env
- Gather large dataset for model learning
- Train model
- Train the rest
- Make new meat grinder ring which is taller
- Fit mujoco simulation to data


- Make visual comparison of fitted Mujoco and learned data engine and ground truth
- Compare policies learned on mujoco and learned engine on real platform
- Can we use learned model to optimize a trajectory (with geometrical constraints) slightly for faster time?
    . First try in simulation
    . If works in simulation, obtain a hokuyo and try on real platform
