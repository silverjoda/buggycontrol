Plan:

# Mission: Obtain High performing buggy agent:
- Train gail/airl with 8mln iters
- Try doing gail/airl with time-sampled trajectories instead of distance
- Obtain well trained model

# Mission: Transfer
- Train RMA-style
- Compare RMA-style with trained model transfer
- Try RL with difficult initial state distribution predictor to help with difficult environments

# Mission: Trajectory optimization using TEP
- Code up a moose test problem using gradient barrier functions
- Debug the trajectory optimization problem
- train TEP
- Test TEP trajectory optimization
