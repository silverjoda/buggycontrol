Plan:

# Mission: Obtain High(er) performing buggy agent:
- Add reward scheduling
- Train for more iters
- Change reward to give 1 for waypoint visitation
- Change reward slightly to make tighter waypoint visiting
- Increase max steps to 400 or 500
- Optimize RL parameters using optuna

# Mission: Transfer
- Train RMA-style
- Compare RMA-style with trained model transfer
- Try RL with difficult initial state distribution predictor to help with difficult environments

# Mission: Trajectory optimization using TEP
- Code up a moose test problem using gradient barrier functions
- Debug the trajectory optimization problem
- train TEP
- Test TEP trajectory optimization
