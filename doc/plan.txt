Plan:

# Mission: Obtain High performing buggy agent:
- Put RL to train
- Debug self supervised env.
- Try GAIL

# Mission: Transfer
- Obtain well trained model
- Train RMA-style
- Compare RMA-style with trained model transfer

# Mission: Trajectory optimization using TEP
- Code up a moose test problem using gradient barrier functions
- Debug the trajectory optimization problem
- train TEP
- Test TEP trajectory optimization
