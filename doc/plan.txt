Plan:

# Mission: Obtain High(er) performing buggy agent:
- Train for more iters
- Optimize RL parameters using optuna

# Mission: Transfer
- Train RMA-style
- Compare RMA-style with trained model transfer
- Try RL with difficult initial state distribution predictor to help with difficult environments

# Mission: Trajectory optimization using TEP
- Try second order methods to optimize shortest path between two points
- If above doesn't work, use another method to generate shortest traj
- train TEP
- Test TEP trajectory optimization
